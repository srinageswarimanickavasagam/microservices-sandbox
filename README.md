## Distributed tracing 
sleuth -> micrometer migration<br>
https://www.appsdeveloperblog.com/micrometer-and-zipkin-in-spring-boot/

### Configurations 
- add log specific configurations to config server and add required pom dependencies
- then pull and run the docker image 
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin

### How to check logs
- http://localhost:9411/zipkin/
- here we can simply click on run query or search by traceid. We can get the traceId from console during API call as well.

## API Gateway
- After adding API gateway, all the apis should be accessible with the port defined for API gateway from the postman

### Circuit Breaker 
- this is used to check if the requested service is up/down. we need to add circuit breaker to the calling service
- For eg here we can API gateway from there we are making call to order service which internally calls product/payment service.
- So we need to add circuit breaker to api gateway to check if order service is up/down and also add circuit breaker to order service to check condition of product/payment service.
Status changes
- to configure circuit breaker in api gateway, we just need to configure in application yml file. For order service, since we are using feign clients to access payment/product service we need to configure fallback methods for both the service
- bring down any of the service and validate if we are getting proper exception message
- Reference: https://resilience4j.readme.io/docs/circuitbreaker

### Rate limitter
- Bring up redis image and add pom dependency
- docker run -p 6379:6379 -d redis
- also add the required configuration in gateway yml file
- now if we hit the api from postman too many times, we will see this in status "429 Too Many Requests" with blank response instead of 200 ok

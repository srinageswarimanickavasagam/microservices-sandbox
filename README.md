## Distributed tracing 
sleuth -> micrometer migration<br>
https://www.appsdeveloperblog.com/micrometer-and-zipkin-in-spring-boot/

### Configurations 
- add log specific configurations to config server
- then pull and run the docker image 
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin

### How to check logs
- http://localhost:9411/zipkin/
- here we can simply click on run query or search by traceid. We can get the traceId from console during API call as well.

## API Gateway
- After adding API gateway, all the apis should be accessible with the port defined for API gateway.

### Circuit Breaker 
- this is used to check if the requested service is up/down. we need to add circuit breaker to the calling service
- For eg here we can API gateway from there we are making call to order service which internally calls product/payment service.
- So we need to add circuit breaker to api gateway to check if order service is up/down and add circuit breaker to order service to check condition of product/payment service.
Status changes
- On failure, closed to open that's when we need to call fallback method
- After certain time, open to half open
- If the requests pass during half open, status will change from half open to close or else will be changed to open again
